# Kidney Stone Detection
- This project primarily focuses on detecting kidney stones from a given CT Scan image/ an ultrasound image using image processing and Machine learning techniques.
- The ML Algorithm used in this project is Random Forest.
- The accuracy of this model is 99.7%
- Mannual inspection can be very time consuming and can lead to false predictions at times. This is where our model comes in handy.
- It saves time and predicts accurate results at a very fast pace.
